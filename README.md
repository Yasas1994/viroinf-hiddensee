# VIROINF - Workshop on analysis of viral NGS data & evolutionary history and co-phylogenetics

## Before the workshop
Please install the following software on your laptop before the start of the workshop! It'll help us to stay on time and it may be difficult to download and install everything on site. 

1. Sync this repository! 
2. **R**: R is a free and highly extensible software environment that provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques [(download)](https://www.r-project.org/).
3. **RStudio (optional)**: RStudio provides a friendly front-end for R [(download)](https://www.rstudio.com/).
4. **phangorn**: Phangorn is an R-package that implements methods for phylogenetic reconstruction. 
	- Open **RStudio**
	- Type `install.packages("phangorn")`
	- This should also install the **ape** package, which contains functions for manipulating and visualizing phylogenetic trees.
5. **treebalance**: Treebalance is an R-package that implements methods for calculating tree balance indices. 
	- Open **RStudio**
	- Type `install.packages("treebalance")`
6. **Java 8 or higher (optional)**: Java is required to run BEAST2. It is better to install the JDK (Java Development Kit) than just the JRE (Java Run-time Environment). If you don't want to install Java you can also download BEAST2 binaries that include the Java run-time environment. There are different flavours of Java, for instance the official Java [(download)](http://java.com/download) or the Open JDK [(download)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
7. **BEAST2**: We will use **BEAST v2.6.7** for this workshop to avoid any teething problems with the newly released **BEAST v2.7** [(download)](https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/releases/tag/v2.6.7). 
	- Download and install `BEAST.v2.6.7.Mac.dmg` for MacOS, `BEAST.v2.6.7.Windows.zip` for Windows or `BEAST.v2.6.7.Linux.tgz` for Linux.
	- If you didn't install Java use the files with `_with_JRE.v.2.6.7` in the filename instead.
	- Try to open the **BEAST** and **BEAUti** apps to confirm the installation was successful. You can also try to open and run one of the example XML files that come bundled with it, for instance `BEAST 2.6.7/examples/testBSP.xml`.
	- For more information see https://beast2.org
8. **BEAGLE (optional)**: BEAGLE is a high-performance library that can perform the core calculations in BEAST2 (and many other compatible phylogenetics packages) much much faster. BEAGLE isn't necessary for the workshop, but it is the difference between an analysis that runs in 10 minutes or an hour [(download)](https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib).
	- Test that BEAGLE is working correctly and that BEAST2 can find it by opening the app and checking the boxes "Use BEAGLE library if available" and "Show list of available BEAGLE resources and Quit" and pressing **Run**.
9. **Tracer**: Tracer is a program used to analyse the trace files generated by BEAST1 and BEAST2 (among others). It can be used to look at posterior distributions, check mixing, ESS, parameter correlations and more [(download)](http://beast.community/tracer).
10. **FigTree**: We'll use FigTree to easily visualise trees produced by BEAST2 [(download)](http://beast.community/figtree).
11. **TempEst**: 
11. **IQTREE**:
